<h1 align="center">It's nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹ I'm John.</h1>

I've always had an insatiable desire to explore complex concepts in profound depth. Growing up, I spent much of my time pouring through my parent's encyclopedia collection, and then scouring the internet for more information when those books began to run dry. The heavily structured curriculum of those early school years often failed to quench my intellectual curiosities, and I frequently became restless, and occasionally mischievous, out of sheer boredom. It got to the point where I was placed into a group of like-minded students, who, like me, found solace in solving intricate logic puzzles during recess.

This innate drive persisted throughout my junior high years, and when it finally came time to decide my freshman year coursework, I chose an introductory computer programming course. I had always been fascinated by computers, and felt that if I could control them, I could understand them.

I was hooked. That introductory programming course drove me to take AP Computer Science, and from there, some web design and development courses, and eventually my B.S. in Computer Science.

The sense of accomplishment I derive from coding is unparalleled. There's a unique satisfaction in seeing lines of code come together to create a functioning piece of software. It's a feeling of creative expression and problem-solving that I havenâ€™t been able to find anywhere else. Recently, Iâ€™ve found great interest in the design and implementation of programming languages themselves, and have directed my academic studies towards type theory and compilers. Iâ€™ve also begun building my own systems programming language, Arc, in both C++, and Rust.

I have more than 4 years of experience defining requirements, and designing, implementing, testing and delivering complex web applications using a variety of programming languages and technologies. I am also a certified Scrum Master and M.B.A graduate, and am able to effectively introduce Scrum to teams and organizations, as well as contribute to existing teams. More recently, this has been in .NET/React based environments deployed across both AWS and Azure, but I have also spent significant time with Java/Spring, Angular, and Vue, and on-premises environments.
