The sense of accomplishment I derive from coding is unparalleled. There's a unique satisfaction in seeing lines of code come together to create a functioning piece of software. It's a feeling of creative expression and problem-solving that I haven’t been able to find anywhere else. Recently, I’ve found great interest in the design and implementation of programming languages themselves, and have directed my academic studies towards type theory and compilers. I’ve also begun building my own programming language, Arc, in both C++, and Rust.
